# 3MD4120: Reinforcement Learning 
## Individual Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to apply reinforcement learning methods to a simple game called Text Flappy Bird (TFB). 

## Overview

This project implements two reinforcement learning agents to play the text-based Flappy Bird game, using Monte Carlo and Expected Sarsa algorithms.

## Structure

- `RL-Individual.ipynb`: The training, evaluation, and results for the two reinforcement learning algorithms.
- `flappy_agents.py`: Contains the implementations of Monte Carlo and Expected Sarsa agents.
- `plot_utils.py`: Utility functions.
- `models`: saved agents and results for best agents.
