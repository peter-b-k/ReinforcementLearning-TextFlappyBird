# 3MD4120: Reinforcement Learning 
## Individual Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to apply reinforcement learning methods to a simple game called Text Flappy Bird (TFB). 

This project implements two reinforcement learning agents to play the text-based Flappy Bird game, using Monte Carlo and Expected Sarsa algorithms.
